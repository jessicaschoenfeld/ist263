    <h3>How did you manage traveling on a budget?</h3>
        
    <p>
        The simple answer here is studying abroad is not luxurious travel. You may need to take that 8    hour bus ride or stay at a destination a little farther than wanted but it is all worth it in the end. I also advise to book stuff in advanced because that is always cheaper.

    <h3>How do you know where to stay in each place? </h3>
    <p>
        Research, research, research! We stayed mostly in hostels and airbnbs. This can sometimes be more dangerous but if you do your research, you will be ok. Make sure to always look at reviews and if there is any type of red flag, I recommend looking for some place new.

    <h3>How did you know what to do in each country?</h3>
    <p>
        You don’t! Again, you need to put in time and work. Do your research! Whether that is a google search or asking a friend look into stuff before you go. Tik tok was a huge recourse for me because it gave great advice and recommendations. Make sure you don’t get caught in tourist traps.

    <h3>How do I make sure I am being safe?</h3>
    <p>
        My first rule is always to be respectful. We are known as the loud obnoxious Americans so break that stereotype. Also, always google “things I should know before traveling to …”. Some places have weird laws to abide by, so it is always good to be aware.

<div class="qa-container">
    <h3>What should I pack for my trip?</h3>
    <p>Packing for months in a small suitcase is very hard. Pack your most staple items that you can swap around with other things to look good. Also remember people dress a little more conservative in Europe so no ripped jeans or crops tops, look classy. You will also do a ton of shopping there so save some room in your luggage.

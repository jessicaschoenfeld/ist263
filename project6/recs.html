<h2>Switzerland</h2>
<h3>Interlaken</h3>
<p>Description: An absolute beautiful town in Switzerland that makes you feel like you are in a Christmas village. A lot of outdoor activities and chocolate focused festivities. It is surrounded by a beautiful blue lake.</p>
<h4>Activities</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chocolate making class: we went through the company Funky Chocolate</li>
    <li>Kayaking: Hightide Kayak School</li>
    <li>Skiing: They have ski rentals in town, and you can take a train to the mountain. It is called the Jungfrau region. Warning: you need to be an experienced skier it is not easy.</li>
    <li>Paragliding & Skydiving: I didn’t do this, but Interlaken is known for these activities so do your research.</li>
</ul>

<img src="../projectimages/skitrip.jpeg" alt="skiing">

<h4>Food</h4>
<ul>
    <li>They aren’t really known for good food here unless you want to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Funky chocolate- we ate here after out chocolate making class.</li>
    <li>Just walk around and find cute little coffee/chocolate shops to eat at. </li>     
</ul> 
    
<h4>Where we stayed/how we got there:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Backpackers Villa Sonnehof Hostel: It was very clean, good location, and a good price.</li>
    <li>Bus2Alps: We went through this company which picked us up in Florence and bussed us to Interlaken. It was a long bus ride but not too bad and less expensive.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Tips:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Book ahead! This is a very popular destination for students, so activities fill up fast so book things before you come.</li>
    <li>It is very expensive! Try new things but really prioritize what you want to do as the activities are expensive.</li>
    <li>If you are in Florence, do Bus2Alps company. They made the whole experience very seamless as they guided you through skiing and other activities.</li>
    <li>If you are to ski, make sure you have a buddy and have skied before. It is challenging so be aware of that. If you can’t ski, you can still go and enjoy the mountains.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zurich</h3>
<p>Description: Another beautiful city in Switzerland. I went here in May and everything was so green and crisp. Zurich is more like a real city with a lot of shopping, restaurants, tall buildings, etc.</p>

<h4>Tips:</h4>

    <li>Everything is very expensive here as well so plan accordingly.</li>
    <li>Zurich is a great destination to do day trips from. For example, we went to Lucerne which is an hour train, and it was like a fairyland.</li>

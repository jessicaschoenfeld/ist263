        <h1>Jessica Schoenfeld Biography</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jessica Schoenfeld and
         I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. 
         I am pursuing my BS in <strong>Applied Data Analytics.</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
        Over my time here at Syracuse I really grew a love for 
         technology and how fast changing and relevant it is to life.
        Some important skills that I have acquired are:
     </p>
         
          <ul>
            <li>R Studio</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>MS Applications</li>
            </ul> 
         
        <p>
        These skills have helped me 
        land a full-time job at KPMG as a Technology Assurance Associate
        after I graduate in 2024. 
        </p>
           
           <h2> Personal Information </h2>
           <p>
           Outside of work I am involved on
            campus in the Tech fraternity, KTP, and social sorority, APEHI.
             I also really enjoying working out and being outside. 
             When I am not being active, I love to watch Netflix and 
             funny movies. I also recently got back from studying abroad
              in Florence and it really grew my love for travel and
               experiencing new cultures. Iâ€™m excited for my last year at 
               Syracuse and to keep evolving my skills as a professional and 
               friend.
               </p>

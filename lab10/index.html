        <h1>Jessica Schoenfeld Biography</h1>
        <main>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jessica Schoenfeld and
         I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. 
         I am pursuing my BS in <strong>Applied Data Analytics.</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
        Over my time here at Syracuse I really grew a love for 
         technology and how fast changing and relevant it is to life.
        Some important skills that I have acquired are:
     </p>
         
          <ul>
            <li>R Studio</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>MS Applications</li>
            </ul> 
         
        <p>
        These skills have helped me 
        land a full-time job at KPMG as a Technology Assurance Associate
        after I graduate in 2024.

           <h2> Personal Information </h2>
           <p>
           Outside of work I am involved on
            campus in the Tech fraternity, KTP, and social sorority, APEHI.
             I also really enjoying working out and being outside. 
             When I am not being active, I love to watch Netflix and 
             funny movies. I also recently got back from studying abroad
              in Florence and it really grew my love for travel and
               experiencing new cultures. I’m excited for my last year at 
               Syracuse and to keep evolving my skills as a professional and 
               friend.

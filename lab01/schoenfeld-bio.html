        Hi, my name is Jessica Schoenfeld and I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. I am pursuing my BS in Applied Data Analytics. Over my time here at Syracuse I really grew a love for technology and how fast changing and relevant it is to life. Some important skills that I have acquired are in R Studio, SQL, Python, and MS applications. These skills have helped me land a full-time job at KPMG as a Technology Assurance Associate after I graduate in 2024. Outside of work I am involved on campus in the Tech fraternity, KTP, and social sorority, APEHI. I also really enjoying working out and being outside. When I am not being active, I love to watch Netflix and funny movies. I also recently got back from studying abroad in Florence and it really grew my love for travel and experiencing new cultures. Iâ€™m excited for my last year at Syracuse and to keep evolving my skills as a professional and friend.
